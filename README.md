# Wiki Search provides a way to search wikipedia without going on the wiki site
### On load, random wiki articles are shown. Click on the button and the link will open to wikipedia
* All pictures, titles, and paragraphs are pulled from wikipedia using their API and [wtf_wikipedia](https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia) API. 
* other references are [Building a Wiki Search App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-wikipedia-search-engine-project-4d84de3841d2/)
